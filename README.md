- Read **negative reviews** on the store page.
    - Read 1-star reviews → often reveal hidden malware/ads.
- Verify if the **developer is known** and trusted.
- Look for excessive permissions (all-site access, browsing history, clipboard).

### Step 4 – Identify Suspicious Extensions
Mark extensions as:
- ✅ Safe – Trusted and verified.
- ⚠️ Suspicious – Extra permissions, unverified developer.
- ❌ Malicious – Known risks like ads, spyware, data theft.

#### ➡️ Online Security Scanners

- [CRXcavator](https://www.crxcavator.io) → Analyze Chrome extensions for risky permissions, outdated libraries, and suspicious behavior.

- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) → You can upload .crx (Chrome extension file) or provide URLs to scan for malware.

- [Extension Monitor by 1Password](https://1password.com/extension-monitor/) → Checks if extensions are safe or have known vulnerabilities.

### Step 5 – Remove Suspicious/Unnecessary Extensions
- Remove ❌ and ⚠️ extensions immediately.
